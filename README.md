You didn't really need to readme but here we are

This is a project for my college where the brief is as such:


The software development company you work for has secured a new contract to develop
a digital solution for GibJohn Tutoring.
GibJohn Tutoring currently provides customers with:

• face-to-face tutoring sessions

• access to learning resources

• support to develop understanding in different subjects




The client (owners of GibJohn Tutoring) would like to develop a digital solution that will:

• provide interactive teaching and learning resources in a range of subjects

• provide access to digital content to encourage wider learning

• support assessment and monitoring of learner progress




The client has carried out some market research with existing customers and tutors to
identify features that could be included in the digital solution. The potential features
suggested by the client are:

• collaborative teaching and learning tools

• accessibility features to support a wide range of users

• a learning reward system

• gamified learning




This is the solution code for the website.
